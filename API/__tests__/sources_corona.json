Given all the recruitment molecules, the cytokines, found in the lungs of COVID-19  patients, it is clear that a driving cause of damage in the disease is by the mis-recruitment of the neutrophiles to the lung.

But it is important to understand that you – even if you are not at risk – might be a risk factor for others, like people with critical medical preconditions. In the current situation you should not think of yourself but of others. Not only can this save lives, but on the scale of whole societies, it will also diminish the spread of the virus and help to keep infections low. "

New York mandated staggered shifts at factories to reduce rush hour commuter traffic. Seattle’s mayor ordered his constituents to wear face masks. The first study found a clear correlation between the number of interventions applied and the resulting peak death rate seen. Perhaps more importantly, both studies showed that while interventions effectively mitigated the transmission of influenza virus in 1918, a critical factor in how much death rates were reduced was how soon the measures were put in place."
