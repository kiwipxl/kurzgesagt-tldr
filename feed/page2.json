In the year 2019  we were still pumping out  around 37 billion more.  That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes  of  other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.

Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.\n\nAnd after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.

While we tried to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day: large animals seem to be immune to cancer. Which doesn’t make any sense – the bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.\n\nSources & further reading: \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/sourcespetosparadox/\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE by FUNK\nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES by WIX\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3cjYgvW\nBandcamp:     https://bit.ly/39h7E1C\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nDennis Barzanoff, HGING231, Taylor Sutton, Agazzy Kan, Isabelle Sagastume, Richard Larsen, Carini, Arvīds Pelēcis, chrisnov, Anish Weerasooriya, Erik Stafford, Apoorva Chandra, Renee Annan, Alex Cross, Jan Karlík, Alexander Fielding, Lukas Schmidt, André, Jianzhuo Wu, Dina Andrei, Iskandar 323, Promethius84 ., Michael Altherr, Devon Meyer, Honza Tomášek, Da Yi, stephanie santos, Kyrill Abrams, Scott Blechman, Alexandre Valdetaro, Balázs Varju, TheBozzCL, Bufe, Mr_Blu42, Kamil, Scott, Alan Lu, Chris Gardner, Youssef Adib, Sean Markham, R, Severin Klingler, Sebastian, Gurneel Kang, SatanicPanic, ohad shalev, Grayson Gordon, 健樑 黃, Taavi Taijala, Lara Rimassa, Paul Wittau, Sir.

This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.\n\nOnly the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.\n\nIf something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance.

Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. \nThis led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   \nBut the big picture conceals  the details. \n\nLet us look at one region in particular: \nSub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.\nWhile some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. \nSuch growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. \nSo is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people? \n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/2Pgk5mD\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/2Ebipoa\nYoutube: https://bit.ly/34h7YKl\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4\n \n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nPatrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet","duration":"PT7M43S","last_scraped":1606808679517,"numComments":21268,"numDislikes":7279,"numLikes":236580,"numViews":5702108,"publishedAt":"2019-12-15T13:30:10Z","tags":["Africa","Sub-Saharan Africa","Overpopulation","Population","World Population","human","mankind","fertility","poverty","education","contraception","contraceptives","birth rates","Asia","Bangladesh","income","child mortality","economy","South Korea","India","Thailand","Philippines","culture Ethiopia","health","Botswana","Sierra Leone","Subsaharan Africa"],"thumbnails":{"defaultUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMo3nZHVrZ4/default.jpg","mediumUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMo3nZHVrZ4/mqdefault.jpg","highUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMo3nZHVrZ4/hqdefault.jpg","standardUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMo3nZHVrZ4/sddefault.jpg","maxresUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NMo3nZHVrZ4/maxresdefault.jpg"},"title":"Overpopulation & Africa","soundTrackUrl":"https://soundcloud.com/epicmountain/rundfunk","soundtrack":{"url":"https://soundcloud.com/epicmountain/rundfunk","last_updated":1606811016444}}]
