She can’t leave the nest for food – so she has to economize her energy. She produces many but small workers, the minims, which will take care of her and the brood. As the colony matures and more workers are available, the queen will be provided with enough resources like food and nurses to produce larger workers.

And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it shrinks and is overrun or starves to death.</h4><p>A large war in which a colony is completely exterminated in one single battle is very unlikely in the weaver ant world. The more realistic scenario for colony death is losing too much territory to sustain workers. And a queen with no pawns is likely to be killed in a raid, starves, or is eaten by predators for the lack of guards.</p><p>Quote: “Colony death tends to be rare in territorial battles in ants, unless the queen(s) are killed. But that is hard to do in these ants because the queens will be central in the territory and they often have more than one*. More likely is that a losing colony has its territory squeezed in. Maybe losing whole trees from its multiple-tree territory. Full territory loss is essentially the same as colony death: a weaver ant colony cannot exist with no territory to call its own.”</p><p>*Comment: Usually the Oecophylla ants only have one queen. To have two or more, is special about the O. smaragdina ants from northern Australia.
