Over the course of the study more than 5,000 patients with brain tumors were frequently questioned about their cell phone use over the past four years. The object of research were two kinds of tumors: gliomas (tumors in the central nervous system of the brain) and meningiomas (mostly benign tumor in the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system) – both of them are very rare types of cancer. </p><p>The result:</p><p>Average cell phone use did not increase the risk of cancer in patients. However, incidents of gliomas and meningiomas increased by 40% and by 15% in sick people with intense cell-phone use. </p><p>Oddly enough, for frequent cell phone uses the cancer risk was about 20% lower compared to the average cell phone user. The authors of the study attributed this result to statistical imprecision. But according to this logic the other findings of this study might suffer from statistical imprecision as well.
