most of us never think about it.​ But is there such a thing as too much electricity?​ Could the thing that is the foundation of the modern world​ slowly be killing us?​ Before we dive deeper,​ let&#x27;s try to understand what electricity is,​ and how it affects us.​ Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.​ This movement generates ​​Electric​ and ​Magnetic Fields​ that spread out through space and carry energy.<br/><br/> We call this phenomenon:​ ​​​Electromagnetic Radiation​.​ Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous.​ But, to radiate just means, &quot;giving off&quot;.​ Like when the radiator in your house gives off heat​ in the form of infrared radiation.​ Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum​ correspond to different types of radiation.​ And, many of them are perfectly harmless.​ Some of them can be dangerous though.​ Radiation with very short wavelengths​ like UV Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays​ are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms,​ which can cause burns and genetic damage.<br/><br/> This is what many people have in mind when they hear the term &quot;radiation&quot;.​ The rest of the spectrum covers a large range of longer waves​ from Visible Light, Infrared,​ Microwaves, to Radio Waves.​ This is the kind of radiation that&#x27;s emitted by all sorts of human technology.​ Mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers,​ electric power lines, and household appliances.​ This radiation doesn&#x27;t disrupt molecules in our body.​ However, some kinds of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves​ and can also make the hair on your body vibrate,​ which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling above certain threshold values.<br/><br/> Other kinds are useful for making dinner.​ Microwaves push the water molecules in your food around​ which warms it up.​ This happens to us all the time.​ For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach​ is your skin heating up from exposure to​ electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.​ We are surrounded by natural, and generally harmless,​ sources of electromagnetic radiation all the time​ and always have been.​ But, since the Industrial Revolution,​ we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.<br/><br/> The question of whether this is actually dangerous​ first got public attention when a 1979 study​ linked leukemia to living near power lines.​ This particular study was quickly discredited though.​ The connection could not be explained​ and no direct causal link was confirmed.​ But once this had been proposed, the idea persisted.​ And the thousands of studies about possible dangers​ illustrate that it&#x27;s still seen as a very real threat.​ A lot of people claim to be sensitive to the radiation​ coming from our appliances and cell phones.<br/><br/> They report symptoms like headaches,​ nausea, skin reactions,​ burning eyes, or exhaustion.​ But those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.​ A few studies have found much more unsettling results.​ Like, possible connections between the side of the brain,​ which people use when they are on their phones,​ and the appearance of brain tumors.​ The question that science is trying to answer,​ is not so much about the acute effects of irradiation.​ We know, for example,​ that x-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells​ but that the same doesn&#x27;t happen with radio waves.<br/><br/> The question is rather:​ Is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation we are constantly surrounded by​ harmful in the long run as a result of some as-yet-unknown mechanism?​ Answering this question was much harder than we first thought.​ There are thousands of primary sources,​ reports, and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.​ So, we read a lot for this video.​ You can take a look at our research in the video description.​ What we found is that this debate is a good example​ of how science should be communicated and how it shouldn&#x27;t.<br/><br/> Many of the much-cited studies that spread panic about electromagnetic radiation​ are highly controversial.​ For example,​ a series of population studies based on surveys and self-reporting.​ What this means is, for example,​ asking brain tumor patients how much they think they used their phone in the last few years.​ The problem is that people are unreliable.​ We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.​ On top of this,​ studies or media reports may be cherry picking the findings that best suit their opinion​ or make for the most exciting headline.<br/><br/> For example,​ a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation.​ The results seemed to show a connection.​ But, for some reason, only in male rats.​ And, none at all in mice.​ But it was ​​reported​ as if this study did prove​ that mobile phone radiation causes cancer.​ Unfortunately, this is the case for studies with both positive and negative findings on the issue.​ Another aspect, is that the WHO did officially classify radio frequency fields​ as possibly carcinogenic.<br/><br/> But what this actually means​ is that there are some hints that they might cause cancer,​ but we can&#x27;t prove it, and that we will keep an eye out.​ So, if we zoom out a bit, what&#x27;s the big picture?​ On the whole,​ there was no consistent evidence in human studies​ that electromagnetic radiation below exposure value limits causes health problems.​ There are some statistical associations​ but they&#x27;re mostly weak and inconsistent.​ If there were any definite cause-effect relations​ we would know by now because of all the data we have.<br/><br/> So, based on the current state of science,​ should you worry about the radiation from your laptop, or cell phone, or TV?​ The answer is no.​ You shouldn&#x27;t.​ But what about the people who say it ​​is​ harming them?​ Research show they could be experiencing​ ​what&#x27;s known as the ​​Nocebo Effect​.​ If you have a headache and happen to start feeling better right when you switch off your laptop,​ you might see a connection between those two things.​ Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone that weak radiation might harm you​ could be the very thing harming you.<br/><br/> It&#x27;s easy to belittle these people;​ most of them feel they&#x27;re not being taken seriously,​ which makes the situation even worse for them.​ They should get support.​ But, it&#x27;s important to be aware that, so far,​ we have no robust evidence that electricity below safety limits has any negative effect on humans.​ In the attention economy we live in,​ talking about unproven dangers can make us neglect things that we know for sure are bad for us.​ Just one example:​ Outdoor air pollution is linked to 4.<br/><br/> million premature deaths each year,​ and is definitely something we could have a real impact on today.​ Still, to make people feel safe, and just to make sure,​ there are several long-term studies ongoing already.​ For example, the Cosmos study that will look at the possible health impacts of cell phone use​ by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.​ But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies,​ there are a lot more pressing problems to focus on.<br/><br/> Like, instead of worrying what devices and networks do to your health,​ consider how they can harm you in other ways.​ When we shop online, share photos,​ or watch YouTube videos,​ we leave a trail of accounts and passwords all over the Internet.​ Radio waves may not hurt us,​ but people trying to take advantage of our data certainly will.​ If a service becomes compromised, hackers can get your password.​ And, if you use the same login details anywhere else,​ they can easily slip into your other accounts.<br/><br/> That&#x27;s why we use ​​dashlane​.​ It&#x27;s just one app to stay safe online on any device,​ operating system, or browser.​ It creates super-strong,
