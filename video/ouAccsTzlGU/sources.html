The only possibility to survive for our ancestors was to eat meat. Some species, such as the Australopiths, were not able to adapt their digestive system to such a drastic change in their diets and went extinct as a result. The reason that enabled our ancestors to switch to a meat based diet is that they had started to eat a lot of nuts and seeds even earlier. The high content of fat prepared our body for digesting so much meat. </p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">1.</span><a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/03/30/why-humans-started-eating-meat-critical-diet/" target="_blank">Why humans started eating meat—and is it critical for our diet?, 2018</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://geneticliteracyproject.org" target="_blank" style="background-color:#ffed6f80;border-color:#c9bb3e;color:#958b00">geneticliteracyproject.org</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p><p>The Article above refers to this book:</p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">2.</span><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780465036622" target="_blank">Meathooked, 2016</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://indiebound.org" target="_blank" style="background-color:#bc80bd80;border-color:#8b528d;color:#5c275f">indiebound.org</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">3.</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16990" target="_blank">Impact of meat and Lower Palaeolithic food processing techniques on chewing in humans, 2016</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://nature.com" target="_blank" style="background-color:#b3de6980;border-color:#81ac39;color:#517d00">nature.com</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">4.</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.19513!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/531139a.pdf" target="_blank">Food processing, 2016</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://nature.com" target="_blank" style="background-color:#b3de6980;border-color:#81ac39;color:#517d00">nature.com</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p></div><div class="sources-key-point"><h4>Biologically we need to eat for three reasons: for energy, to acquire  materials to fabricate our cells and to get special molecules that our bodies can’t make themselves.</h4><p>The two main reasons we eat are to gain energy in the form of ATP and to renew and replace our cells.
