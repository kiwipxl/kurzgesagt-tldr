It feels like a huge bureaucracy is making decisions over our heads. Many Europeans think that their vote  in the EU elections doesn&#x27;t count, and that the EU  is not democratic. How democratic  is the EU really? And, does your vote  actually achieve anything? In democratic states, public policies are based  on the will of the people.<br/><br/>But, the people are not a coherent thing. Countless different groups are battling for influence and power to establish laws  and rules that benefit them. In a working democracy, there are checks  and balances that are supposed  to create a fair environment where these battles  can be fought. Term limits stop factions  from dominating too much. But all of this ends  at our borders. International politics  are not democratic, but anarchic. No central authority is powerful enough to ensure fairness, or enforce laws, so the only law is the tyranny of the strongest, and anarchy.<br/><br/>So for most of human history, powerful countries took what they wanted from others either by extortion or by violence. After World War Two, the United Nations were founded to overcome this anarchy by establishing rules  on how countries should behave. But since the UN has  virtually no power, and its members  often have opposing interests, it&#x27;s usually politely ignored. The EU is a construct that tries to have rules and laws for its member nations that are actually enforceable, as the European Court of Justice is able to make binding decisions.<br/><br/>Originally, the EU was founded to ensure peace between European nations and prosperity  for the continent. But it&#x27;s also an attempt to gain international power for its members. It&#x27;s like a super state and it&#x27;s striving to be democratic and legitimized by all of its citizens. To do that, it has to solve the problem of different actors wanting different things. Only, that its members are countries with very different priorities. So, how does this work? Since the EU  is ridiculously complex, and politicians are even worse  than scientists at naming things, we&#x27;ll simplify massively and omit  a lot of details.<br/><br/>You can find further reading and explanations in our Sources Document. OK, if you want to create a democratic union of independent nations, you have two options. you have two options. One: Let everybody vote  for national politicians who then make decisions  for the Union together. Or, two: Let every citizen vote directly for an independent institution that&#x27;s able to make  binding decisions. Both approaches have  their upsides and downsides, and the EU ended up  with a mix of both of them.<br/><br/>Next to the European  Court of Justice, there are four main institutions  that we&#x27;ll talk about today. The European Council, which is made up of the heads of government or states of the member countries. The Council of the EU, with ministers  from the member countries. The third one is  the European Commission, which is the de facto  government of the EU, having one Commissioner  for each member state. And, lastly, the European Parliament. The Parliament  is the only part of the EU that is directly elected  by you, dear Citizen, in the European elections.<br/><br/>In principle, all of these institutions of the EU originate from your direct or indirect vote, be it at the national or EU level. But some  do more than others. For example, you vote for  your national representative and therefore contribute  to form a national government whose head of state has a seat  in the European Council. These leaders choose the president of the EU Commission and its fellow commissioners, who eventually are confirmed  by the EU Parliament.<br/><br/>So, this is a sort of  indirect democracy. You didn&#x27;t vote for the Commission, but you voted for the people  who appointed them and for those who confirmed  and police them. So, in effect, 2.5 of the 4 main European Union institutions depend on the member state governments. But since you, as a citizen, can only directly vote for the European Parliament, the question is, &quot;â€‹How powerful is it?&quot; How much influence  does your vote have? The European Parliament started out with very little influence but has become more and more powerful over the past two decades.<br/><br/>Today, it has  to approve new laws which can be binding  for the member countries. It also votes on how  the EU budget is spent and on international treaties. All of this makes  the Parliament very powerful and, thus, your vote  very influential, even on an international level. Compared to national parliaments, one major power is still missing though. The EU Parliament officially can&#x27;t propose new laws on its own which is often the core of the argument the EU is not Democratic enough and that the European Parliament should be given more influence.<br/><br/>Right now, the member states&#x27; governments pretty much control the European Union. Giving the Parliament more power would make the EU, as a whole, more democratic but it would also take power  from member states. It&#x27;s not clear  which approach is better. Ultimately it&#x27;s for the Member States and us as citizens to decide how the Union should develop. OK, so can we draw  a conclusion here? As a whole, the EU is not as democratic  as most of its member states.<br/><br/>But it is democratic. If you don&#x27;t like decisions they make, regarding copyright, for example, you can look up what your representatives voted for and vote them out. The struggle to make it  more democratic is closely tied  to who holds power over what. The EU keeps changing. You, dear Citizen, are not only voting  on the current politics but also on what the system  will look like in the future. There are many parties and politicians that vow to make the EU Parliament, and therefore  your vote, stronger.<br/><br/>Many others want  to keep it as it is, or even diminish it. It&#x27;s for you to decide what you think is better for the future of the Union. Currently, it&#x27;s equally important for the EU who you vote for at home, because these are the people who have the most influence in the European Union right now. Opinion At home is also where the EU  is often used as a scapegoat. Politicians, especially  before national elections, like to pretend the EU is all-powerful and mix up rules and laws over the heads of the governments and citizens.<br/><br/>Although, often, they were directly responsible for what the EU did. Democracy is annoying and complicated, and often very boring. In the European Union, even more so  than in the Member States. But, voting and caring about how our political institutions change and develop is one of the most powerful things  we can do as citizens. The last few years have shown that extreme things can happen through elections. We have to decide if we want to be an active part of this process.<br/><br/>If we don&#x27;t take part in the struggle for power that is politics, others will. And we might not like  what they decide for us. Because Europe is  an important topic for us, we&#x27;ve translated this video into as many European languages as possible. A couple of European YouTubers narrated it, and uploaded it  to their own channels. Thank you to Funk and all YouTubers who helped us.
