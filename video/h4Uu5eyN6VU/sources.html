The original anarchy on the international level is gradually diminished by interdependency. Social and economical organisations are cross-border dependant on each other. Because international collaboration is an advantage for the involved actors, more and more organisations will be interested in global networking, which will ultimately lead to global collaboration – at least that’s what the theory says. </p><p>No theory of international politics is undisputed and it’s still not decided which one of them will gain acceptance in the political sciences. </p><p>So it’s very complicated and in this field it’s barely possible to state something that all theories would support equally.</p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">4.</span><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~slaughtr/Articles/722_IntlRelPrincipalTheories_Slaughter_20110509zG.pdf" target="_blank">International Relations, Principal Theories, 2011</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://princeton.edu" target="_blank" style="background-color:#bebada80;border-color:#8e8aa8;color:#605d79">princeton.edu</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p></div><div class="sources-key-point"><h4>But since the UN has virtually no power and its members often have opposing interests it is usually politely ignored.</h4><p>The first major problem of the UN is that in its most important committee, the Security Council, the permanent members France, Great Britain, the USA, Russia and China each hold the right of veto. That means each one of them can block a decision. Since these five countries already hold different opinions regarding many questions, there is rarely an agreement.</p><p>The second problem is that the International Court of Justice (the main institution for judicature of the UN) only is allowed to step in if all involved parties agree with it. Additionally there is no international executive, which could enforce the Court of Justice’s sentences. So in reality, the conviction and enforcement of sentences completely rely on the collaboration with the accused state, which makes it hard to enforce sentences.</p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">5.</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations" target="_blank">United Nations,  Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2019</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://britannica.com" target="_blank" style="background-color:#8dd3c780;border-color:#5da296;color:#2c7369">britannica.com</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">6.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_United_Nations" target="_blank">Wikipedia-Article: Criticism of the United Nations</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org" target="_blank" style="background-color:#d9d9d980;border-color:#a8a8a8;color:#797979">en.wikipedia.org</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p><span class="citation-link"><span class="sources-number">7.</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/americas/united-nations-un-explainer.html" target="_blank">The United Nations Explained: Its Purpose, Power and Problems, New York Times, 2017</a><a class="sources-domain-tag" href="http://nytimes.com" target="_blank" style="background-color:#ccebc580;border-color:#9bb994;color:#6c8967">nytimes.com</a></span><br/><span class="sources-quote"></span><p></p></div><div class="sources-key-point"><h4>The EU is a construct that tries to have rules and laws for its member nations that are actually enforceable.</h4><p>Legal acts of the EU can be objected by the European Court of Justice.
