For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter. Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart? Or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost. Currently, Earth&#x27;s deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain.<br/><br/>It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than the dark grave of the Titanic. It&#x27;s one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore. Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it&#x27;s a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans. A great place for our nuclear test. We&#x27;ll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb or Tsar Bomba. Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times, and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky.<br/><br/>Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble.

The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times, the bubble shrinking and growing, until eventually the bubble loses for good.

It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud as it disintegrates into many smaller, hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards.<br/><br/>And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing. Just a small wave, and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific. No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time.
