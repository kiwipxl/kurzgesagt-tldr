For example, they may replace a small but inefficient fridge with a larger, more efficient one, that offers more space, but has similar or even higher energy consumption. Even if a product is replaced with a more efficient one, lower energy bills mean that consumers have more money to spend on goods and services.

It simply states that any additional input after a certain point in the production process of a commodity would yield gradually smaller increases in the output.
