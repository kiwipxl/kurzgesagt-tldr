{"pageProps":{"vid":"AQPlREDW-Ro","containerDetails":{"title":"Iraq Explained -- ISIS, Syria and War","hasSources":false,"hasTranscript":true,"hasSoundTrack":true,"hasTags":true},"description":"The current crisis in Iraq explained in under 5 minutes.\n\nThere is war in Iraq? Again? And the US and Iran are talking about working together? And who is this ISIS Terrorist group that is all over the news? And Religion? Oh dear... When exactly has the world gone mad again? \n\nIt is not possible to explain a complicated topic like this without simplification. We are very aware that this video is not painting a full picture of the situation. But we hope that it may lay the foundation on which you can try to do your own research and understand how horribly Fu**ed up the whole situation is. \n\nWe did have to produce the video super fast -- thanks a lot to our friends Martin Wackerbauer and Magnus Schlüter for helping us out -- we would not have been able to make this video in time without you guys!\n\nKurzgesagt loves all people as long as they don't hurt others and don't hinder mankind on its quest to the stars. So it was very sad to read so much terrible stuff about the situation in Iraq. Hopefully it will get better.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nYou can get the music of the video here: http://thomasveith.bandcamp.com/track/iraq-explained\n\nVideos, explaining things.
