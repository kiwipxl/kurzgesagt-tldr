There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. \n\nWe have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it  so hard to just stop emitting these gases?\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud:   https://bit.ly/347oNcH\nBandcamp:     https://bit.ly/3cI1hGN\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nKeanu Vestil, Xavier, Antonio Tavano, Scott James, Camfifty5, Michael, Paul Barth, Christian Puelacher, Katie Barton, Cole Bowden, Andreas Rautner, Sovos, Alejandro Uresti, couchy, Bill Hochberg, John Specht, Lander Verhack, Vlad Mustiață, Oliver Kurtz, Mischa Blazer, Josh Yelavich, Islam Mohamed, Robrecht Cannoodt, Kirsty, Greenleaves, Jayson Lamanca, Nithin Thaha, Tristan Jackson, Even_skjeih, Mo Alawami, Jonas Brandão, Lily McAdams, Alejandro Rodriguez, Isaac Overmyer, Cooper Norton, Biblion, Stephen Zappia, Bodo Nuber, Samhain, Kyle Goff, jota jodra, Marc Bornträger, Filip Leszczyński, Влад Кальченко, NexusValhalla, Aleksandar Zivancevic, Silas Zander, Tijn Flinterman, Shrutika Umralkar, Or Bairey-Sehayek, Terri-Ann dela Cruz, Choltikan Phothong, Collin Carey, Champ, Marcela Oliveira, rbtpzk, Jamie Grall, LAI Oscar, Ralf P., Kuba, Ryan Giles, JoghurtWiesel, Timster Ruu, John Highet, Walmyr Carvalho, Perry Williams, Aldo Vicente, Peter Paj, Vanny Khon, Olga, Theeraphong Gasparini, destroymyarrogance, Martin Pietrowski, Josip Haramija, Champ, Carlos, Davi & Nicholas","lastUpdated":1607507666208,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
