Until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer. In just a hundred years the human population quadrupled. \nThis led to  apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. World population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.   \nBut the big picture conceals  the details. \n\nLet us look at one region in particular: \nSub-Saharan Africa. In 2019 it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it is still much higher than in the rest of the world.\nWhile some projections expect around 2.6 billion people others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. \nSuch growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. \nSo is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people? \n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/2Pgk5mD\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/2Ebipoa\nYoutube: https://bit.ly/34h7YKl\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4\n \n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nPatrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet","lastUpdated":1606808679517,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
