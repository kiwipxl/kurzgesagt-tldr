{"pageProps":{"vid":"xRF7WIZV4lA","containerDetails":{"title":"Help us make more Videos for Kurzgesagt","hasSources":false,"hasTranscript":false,"hasSoundTrack":true,"hasTags":true},"description":"We started a crowd funding to make it possible to make more than one video every four weeks.\n\nhttp://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt\n\nPatreon is a monthly subscription service that you can use to support the online creators you like! \n\nKurzgesagt has gone through the roof in terms of views and subscriptions and it already is way to time intensive that we can properly take care of everything. \nThat's the reason why we still haven't proper subtitles (despite of so many of you guys offering to make them for us!), that's why our website is still a mess and we take weeks to reply to emails. And of course that we only make one video each month and never know when we will be finished.\n\nSo, to solve this hot mess, we are trying to make Kurzgesagt at least a viable \"part time job\" so we can use \"daytime\" to catch up with everything and make more stuff while not risking our livelihood.\n\nLots of you guys wrote us in the last few months and wanted to support us, well, now you can! If you don't want to or don't have the money to spare, no worries! \n\nKURZGESAGT WILL ALWAYS BE A SEMI MONTHLY THING THAT IS FREE FOR EVERYBODY!\n\nWe really appreciate everyone who helps us out and we officially give you moral absolution for using add block if you fund us.\n\nWe didn't start this whole operation to get rich but because it is our passion. And we continue it because it feels right and because of the feedback we get from all of you. It has been a lot of work and a lot of fun. \nThank you so much everybody. Words can not express how we feel about Kurzgesagt and the amazing people it attracted. Thank you for your attention. We are humbled and amazed by all of you.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook","lastUpdated":1606809163991,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
