While some are juste stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust. So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all but a lot of conspiracy theories. It's really simple, just ask yourself: Does the theory affect really rich and powerful people? Is the answer yes? OK, then it's most likely... Not true. Let's test it on three examples. Number one: There is an easy cure for cancer but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies.\n\nHmmm... Do really rich people die of cancer, like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple? Yes? There is no suppressed cure for cancer. Number two: Chemtrails, the theory that airplanes spray chimicals in the air for population control or some of the crazy reason. Do really powerful people breathe air? Do Obama or Putin breathe air? Yes? Chemtrails are not a thing. Number three: Apocalyptic conspiracy theories. The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Mayas Aliens, someone says so.\n\nDo really rich and powerful people ignore the soon to be upon us and a very imminent apocalypse? Yes? The world will not end soon. This obviously doesn't works for every conspiracy theory out there But it does works for some of the most stupid ones. So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in you water, just show him this video and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook.
