The 12,020 human space era calendar has arrived. You can order it now until we sell out, and then never again. In the last few years, we've looked back at the achievements of our ancestors that paved the way for our modern world more than ten thousand years ago. This year, we'll turn our gaze to the future of humanity and how we will explore space in the next ten thousand years. Twelve illustrations will take you to the liquid-gas oceans on Titan, colonies on Mars, the storm clouds on Uranus, and many more stops on humanity's biggest journey yet.\n\nEnjoy solar system-wide delivery, shipping from the US and finally, also from Europe. Order now to get our limited-edition calendar in time for the holidays to make your kids, family, and friends happy or to distract yourself from the looming void within. You know, whatever works for you. You can get the calendar together with a duck plushie, a hoodie, or a poster, if you want; we've put together a few deals. Thank you so much to the thousands of people who got the calendar last year.\n\nBecause of you, we can keep this channel free for everyone and make even more beautiful things. A happy interstellar year, 12,020! *Quieter Kurzgesagt jingle* *howls* ","lastUpdated":1606811024927,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
