Though the nuclear burning proceeds in much the same sequence, the effect they have on the star’s hydrostatic equilibrium depends sensitively on the stars mass (see for example  Figure 2.1 in Lisakov 2018 below). The exact sequence and extent of radial growth, mass loss, and core contraction, and the number of these phases will be largely determined by the initial mass of the star and the stellar models used to calculate their evolution. The video describes roughly what happens without exactly following the evolutionary sequence of any one supernova progenitor."}]},{"title":"Iron is nuclear ash, it has no energy to give and cannot be fused.","content":[{"type":"citation","data":{"url":"https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/mpa/institute/news_archives/news1109_janka/news1109_janka-en-print.html","title":"Max Planck Institute, Cosmic Crashes Forging Gold, 2011","metadata":[]}},{"type":"citation","data":{"url":"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/nucbin.html","title":"Nuclear Binding Energy, retrieved, 2019","metadata":[]}}]},{"title":"An iron ball the size of the earth is squeezed into a ball of pure nuclear matter the size of a city.","content":[{"type":"citation","data":{"url":"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/neutron_stars.html","title":"NASA: Neutron Stars, 2007","metadata":[]}},{"type":"citation","data":{"url":"https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/84444/Physics-and-Neutrino-Physics-Around-Hot-Neutron-Stars","title":"Max Planck Institute, retrieved 2019","metadata":[]}}]},{"title":"But not just the core, the whole star implodes, gravity pulling the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light.
