Barrow. He suggested a classification based on the civilizations’ control of the microworld. Instead of the ability of utilizing power in larger dimensions, he rather suggested the ability to manipulate the power in smaller dimensions as a criteria for categorization of civilizations; from Type I-minus, who is able to manipulate the objects with similar dimensions to themselves to Type VI-minus who is able to manipulate the elementary particles, quarks and leptons. So based on this proposition, humanity has passed through Type III currently and have activities into the scopes of Type IV, V and VI."}]}],"last_scraped":1606790200787,"url":"https://sites.google.com/view/sources-kardashev-scale/","last_updated":1606810980348},"lastUpdated":1606810980348,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
