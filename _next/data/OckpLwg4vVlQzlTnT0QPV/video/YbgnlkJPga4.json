Robot eventually returned but the next day, Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole.\n\nAnd after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a wooly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud:   https://bit.ly/2ZyFvkB\nBandcamp:     https://bit.ly/2Xnbr8C \n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nTim Erbes, Russ Creech, Dmitry, Nathan Ranney, Saul Costa, Ryan Bartling, CRAPIDROPMYAIRPODS, Shwarmle456, Alessandro Menozzi, Patricia Volz, Anders V, Mitchell H, Ignacio Zelada, AnnaD, Mike Li, Melissa Haase, cassy Grasby, Daniel Charanis, Gar Lam, Alexander Kirk, Wafflelopagus, John, Dayton Hughes, Katarzyna Ostrowska, Kathy Hung, Lawrence Kuo, Gabriel Barajas, JNighthawk ., Eliana Howard, Joseph Rocca, David Knight, Jeffrey Hicks, Sean Leach, MKD, Robert Henning, Matt Brown, Thomas Feathers, saviga, Matthias Ruck, Ayman Salam, Federico Rivero, Jason Treggiari, Thomas Waldrop, Maribel Dorner, Brian Moore, Patrick Herring, wjwilde, Claude ONANA, Simon Ochlich, Richard Hoffpauir, Alexis Truitt, Sarah Powell, Michael Green, Louise Wong, Guillermo Morales, Huw Davies, Nikolas Dahn, Chris B, Carlos Gatto, Parya Pasha, Dwight You, Zoe Zuniga, Ramtin Shahryari, Isaac X, Carl Tork, Florian Rüchel, Yosty maynard, playmatefx, Jagan Doodala, Donald Robinson, Gavin W, Joseph Graham, B Nzomo, Stefano Gogioso, James Jetton, WispyMouse, niv goldstein, James Hultgren, Sean McLennan, Mark Sørensen, Victor C, Jessica Price, Laci Krétai, Namrata Bathija, Jeff, Jay Dunstan, Lee, Maxime Romand, Sergey, Dmitry Klimenkov, Stephen Jones, ckolos, Daniel Lindsay, Dani Banner, Alejandro Morales, Lewys Caiach-Taylor, Victor Bareille, LordCheverongo, Roman Lang, Sasha Mamzelev, Elie Crespin, zaxs cat, Rob Schebel, Ben Mitchell, GOTY8, Dan Vicarel, engCybernetics, Antonious","lastUpdated":1606808674453,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
