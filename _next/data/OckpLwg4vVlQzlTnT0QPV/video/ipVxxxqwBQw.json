In the year 2019  we were still pumping out  around 37 billion more.  That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes  of  other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. \nAnd emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeDE \nSpanish Channel: https://kgs.link/youtubeES \n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Merch designed with ❤ from https://kgs.link/shop  \nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧 https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe Soundtrack of this video:\n\nSoundcloud:   https://bit.ly/3djcOuY\nBandcamp:     https://bit.ly/2VjGjH9\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany Thanks to our wonderful Patreons from http://kgs.link/patreon who support us every month and made this video possible:\n\nClaire Kim, בועז ברקוביץ, Jordan Kowal, Philip Lightstone, Josh, Henry Thomas, Peer Fromme, Daniel Something-in-chinese, Joerg Fluegge, Mathieu Haverkamp, Pierre-Antoine, Filipe, Sam, Steven wu, Adam Leos, Biniam Jacob, Autumn, TURRONERO, 메타, 4Felix_HB, Bronwen Dickenson, McLen, Gabi Adler, AZHY ROBERTSON, Mikhail Levchenko, Richard Tran, Cooper Nagengast, Alberto Mina, Michele, Jarrod Brodel, Jeff Cooper, Keith McComb, Bryan Lin, FuzzyLogic, Kaden Archibald, Zeeger Scholten, Adam Górecki-Gomoła, Forrest Henry, Sam Starzynski, Ross Anderson, Mark Neal, Sivda, Anatoly Polinsky, Tony Black, Komala Chenna, Lieberson Pang, henry Defelice, Michael Coors, Ben Wallace, Matt McKee, Mikael Muszynski, Franziska Diez, Marius G, Sona, Xander, Walter_Ego, john dietrich, Arian Feigl-Berger, Alejandro Godinez, Lou, Justin Oliver, Chris, Valentin Jay, Andy Miller, Sabrina Wrobel, Jion Wattimury, Peter Neubauer, Rico Oess, Kai, jp888, Coral Amayi, Todd J., Patrick Havercroft, Joshua Milus, Sudipto Bhattacharya, Pius Ladenburger, Gina Curler, Flemming Lauritzen, Ben, Ezio Auditore, Christopher Hines, Elena Kovakina, Shahaf Milshtein, Oliver Sheldon, Liam Clarke, Mette, Adam Kovalovszki, Patrick Zeymer, Adam Wells, aslfhjdfkjlha, Faustus, Virgile Kuhn, Lua ., Markus, Alan, Andrew McKendry, RexL300, Jakub, Paula Patzova, Jan Kropidlowski, liza_worth, Josef Simonson, Andreas Heller, Griffin vlachos, Albert Diserholt, Kirils Bondars, Asahi Ishikawa, Jan Jaeken, Sanat Deshpande, Lambda3, 竹鴻 柯, Jacob Robbins, David Habada, flickers, JusRus, Nicholas Wolf, Zachariah Jackson, Leon Suhm, Marco Johne, Eren Tatar","lastUpdated":1606808673180,"header":{"showBack":true,"backUrl":"/"}},"__N_SSG":true}
