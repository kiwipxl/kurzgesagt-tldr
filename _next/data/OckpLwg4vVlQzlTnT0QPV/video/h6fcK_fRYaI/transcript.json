It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable. But fatal, none the less. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you... but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off. Trust me. And that's when you met me. What happened? Where am I? You died. I said, matter of factly. No point in mincing words. There was... there was a truck. And it was skidding.\n\nYes. I... I died? Yes. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies. You looked around. There was.. nothingness. Just you, and me. What is this place? Is this, the afterlife? More or less. Are you.. God? Yes. I'm God. My kids.. My wife... What about them? Will they be alright? \"That's what I like to see,\" I said. You just died, and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there. You looked at me with fascination.\n\nTo you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man, or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure maybe. \"Don't worry,\" I said. They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you. Your wife will cry on the outside. But will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved. Oh.. So what happens now? Do I go to Heaven? Or Hell or something? Neither.\n\nYou'll be reincarnated. Ah.. So the Hindus were right! All religions are right in their own way. Walk with me. You followed along as we strolled through the void. Where are we going? No where in particular. It's just nice to talk while we walk. So, what's the point then? When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate right? A baby? So, all my experiences and everything... everything I did in this life... Won't matter... Not so. You have within you, all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.\n\nYou just don't remember them right now. I stopped walking, and took you by the shoulders. Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water. To see if it's hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had.\n\nYou've been in a human for the last 48 years. So you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything. But there's not point to doing that between each life. How many times have I been reincarnated then? Oh, lots! Lots and lots! And into lots of different lives. This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D Wait... What?! You're sending me back in time? Well I guess technically.\n\nTime as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from. Where... where you come from? Oh sure, I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand. \"Oh..\" You said, a little let down. But wait.. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point. Sure, happens all the time.\n\nAnd with both lives only aware of their own lifespans, you don't even know it's happening. or who will ever live,  yes I'm Abraham Lincoln? and your john wilks booth too? (i didn't get what he said) I'm Hitler!!! You said uphold (again i din't get or catch what he said) And you're the millions he killed. I'm Jesus! and you're everyone who followed Him. You fell silent* Every time you victimizing someone you're victimizing myself every act of kindness you've done you've done to yourself every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by YOU you thought for a long time why?  why do all this? because someday you will become like me because that's what you are! you're one of my kind You're my child! Wow!! you said incredulous.\n\n you mean i'm a God? No, not yet, you're a fetus you're still growing. once you've lived every human life throughout all time you will have grown enough to be born so the whole universe... it's just... an egg I answered.. now it's time for you to move on to your next life and I sent you on your way (this is the final clip of this video, made by Kurzgesagt subscribe to him!!!)
