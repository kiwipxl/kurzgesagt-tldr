But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So we teamed up with the awesome blog \"Wait but Why\" and made this video to help you putting things in perspective with some infographics! \n\nThis video has been a collaboration of KURZGESAGT & WAITBUTWHY!\n\nhttp://www.waitbutwhy.com/\n\nWAIT BUT WHY: AN AWESOME BLOG that shows you new perspectives on your life. Visit them, tell them hi from us! :D Trust us, it is worth your time!\n\nhttp://www.waitbutwhy.com/\n\nYou can get the MUSIC of this video here: http://bit.ly/1dUEBwI .The \"Album\" includes two versions: the original version from the video and a more \"songish\" version. Thomas will receive all of the the revenue, so you'll support the artist responsible directly. :)\n\nShort videos, explaining things. For example Evolution, the Universe, Time, the Stock Market or controversial topics like Fracking. Because we love science.\n\nWe would love to interact more with you, our viewers to figure out what topics you want to see.
